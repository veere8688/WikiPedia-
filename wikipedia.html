            <p>Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber[1] /ˈliːbər/; December 28, 1922–November 12, 2018) was an
                American comic book writer, editor, publisher and producer. 
                He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called Timely Comics which would
                 later become Marvel Comics. He was Marvel's primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small
                division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film industries.</p>
   
                <p>In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writers and artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created 
                   iconic characters, including Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four,
                    Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, the Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow. These and other characters'
                     introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more naturalistic approach in superhero comics, and, in the 1970s,
                      Lee challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies.
                       In the 1980s, he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.
